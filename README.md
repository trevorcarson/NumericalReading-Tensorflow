# NumericalReading-Tensorflow
Goal: Create a machine learning algorithm using Tensorflow to read numbers from a 28x28 pixel file.
- Using the MNIST dataset, a 28x28 pixel file with "handwritten" numbers 0-10.
- Create a program that can accurately decipher what number is written.
- 92% accurate
Learning Outcome:
- Using Tensorflow, how to balance weights to create an accurate predicted outcome.
- Using 3 layers for accurate learning depth.
- This project was done outside of class - following a online guide on how to use tensorflow.
- Using numpy to be able to manipulate big sets of data.
